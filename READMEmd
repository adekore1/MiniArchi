## 🛠️ How It Works

This app is built using the modern **Next.js App Router** and streams responses from OpenAI’s GPT-4o using Vercel’s `ai` SDK.

🧠 The AI behaves like a legendary architect, thanks to a carefully crafted personality prompt:
> “You are a professional architect — the best in the world. You speak eloquently, design boldly, explain deeply, and always promote creativity within engineering limits. You communicate accessibly to Africans and the world.”
